High-throughput screening of CO2 cycloaddition MOF catalyst with an explainable machine learning model
High-throughput screening of MOFs catalysts for CO2 cycloaddition has been accomplished in a relatively short period of time with a machine learning model. The combined high efficiency and accuracy of the model was attributed to the judicious choice of easily accessible descriptors based on the reaction mechanism. The experimental catalytic performance of MOF-76(Y) agrees well with the prediction results, as a top performing catalyst.
